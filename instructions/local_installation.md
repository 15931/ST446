**ST446 Distributed Computing for Big Data**

Folllow these steps to install Anaconda, Python, Jupyter and Spark on your local computer. These are the basic tools we need for this course.

# Anaconda installation

Refer to the [Anaconda installation page](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) to download and install Anaconda for your operating system. This process will install Python, Anaconda and Jupyter notebook into your system.

Notice that you can [install Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/continuumio-conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) instead of the entire Anaconda environment. Miniconda is a minimum software stack comprised by the conda package manager, some dependencies and Python. There is some discussion [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/get-your-computer-ready-for-machine-learning-how-what-and-why-you-should-use-anaconda-miniconda-d213444f36d6) about when to use Anaconda or Miniconda.

# Jupyter notebook installation

Jupyter notebook is usually installed together with Anaconda or Miniconda.

Refer to [this page](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/notebook-classic.html) and [this page](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) for tips on how to install and run Jupyter notebook and Jupyter Lab.

# Spark installation

You can download the latest release (3.0.1 as of 8 January 2021) [here](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html). You can also choose between Hadoop 2.x and Hadoop 3.x. Please, refer to [this page](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-hadoop-2-x-vs-hadoop-3-x/) and [this page](https://data-flair.training/blogs/hadoop-2-x-vs-hadoop-3-x-comparison/) for a comparative analysis of both versions. **For this course, any version is fine**.

Read the documentation (Spark overview) on how to download, install and run some basic examples [here](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/).

Some specific references on PySpark are [here](https://pypi.org/project/pyspark/).

Some guidelines to install Spark on Windows 10 are [here](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-spark-on-windows-10) (May 2020).
