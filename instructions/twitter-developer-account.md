* App name: choose whatever name you like. I used "st446-kafka".
* Application description: you can describe the related questions in our assignment and say this application will provide the same functionality.
* Website URL: try "https://lse-st446.github.io/"
* Tell us how this app will be used: you can write that this app is used for the assignment from a course named ST446 Distributed Computing for Big Data at LSE. And this app will collect what data from Twitter and do what computation.
