# Seminar class 6: streaming data processing

## Activity before class

Please have a look at the item 6 at [streaming_examples.md](streaming_examples.md) and apply for your Twitter Developer Account (in case you don't have one). You will need this to complete activity 6.

## Class activity

Please go through the streaming examples with Pyspark and Kafka [here](streaming_examples.md).

## Homework

Have a look at the last parts of the class activity and try to run them yourself (in particular the Twitter stream).

## References

If you are particularly interested in stream processing and motivated to do some debugging, have a look at [this notebook](TwitterStreamingAPI.ipynb).

You will need to use the same initialisation actions as in the previous [example](streaming_examples.md) to install all required libraries and packages.
